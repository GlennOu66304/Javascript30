To edit the lay out of the html in the dev tool, you can simply add an attribute into the html element, then change it in the style page:

attribute page:

```
   <div class="hand second-hand" style="transform:rotate(20deg)"></div>
```

style sections:
```
element.style {
    transform: rotate(20deg);
}
```

The key to let the static hour hand running in the site, is to use javascript dynamic give a css value transform rotate to it.
